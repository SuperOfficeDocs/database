These pages describe the user-preferences used in SuperOffice.

> [!NOTE]
> Many of these preferences control important system functions, and changing the values or adding a new preference value may cause the SuperOffice application or specific functionality (like travel or area management) to stop working. **Be very careful when changing these preferences.**
