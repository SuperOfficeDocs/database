# Data dictionary

SuperOffice 8.1 changed the dictionary structure to allow more flexible evolution. We refer to this as CDD - **Continuous Database Development**. It means that database changes can be delivered incrementally.

Partners can also develop and deploy their own custom dictionary steps to add their own fields and tables to the database.

Partner changes will not be overwritten or lost when the database is upgraded.
